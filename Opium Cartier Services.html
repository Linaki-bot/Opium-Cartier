<h4><i>Air Freight</i></h4>
<p> 2 Flights per week It takes a maximum of one week to deliver goods to their final destination but it can take as little as 3 days. We have two flights per week delivering cargo to Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania hence the three days duration. Air Freight is mostly preferred for non volume goods and cases of urgency. To get started with this service, all you need to do is deliver the cargo to our offices and we will deliver it to the final destination. The cargo delivered for shipment should be well labeled with your names, phone number, mode of shipment and final destination.
Pricing and payment; Our Air Freight service is inclusive of customs clearance so when the goods arrive at the final destination we will clear at customs and call you to collect the goods from our offices, or you could choose door-step delivery. We charge Air Freight services per kg and use the greater of actual or volume weight to calculate cost. Payment can be done at the origin or destination office.
